            "2. **Use try-except blocks**: Wrap code that might throw an exception in a try block and handle the exception in an except block.\n",
            "3. **Use list methods**: Instead of directly accessing indices, use list methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `index()`, etc., when possible.\n",
